// Package coalesce batches the ciphertext records a TLS/utls layer emits
// per application write into a single socket write. crypto/tls and utls
// both issue one underlying Write per TLS record; without coalescing a
// 32KB application write costs three write syscalls. The drain points are
// designed around three invariants proven on the anytls path:
//
//   - Read flushes first: every write-then-wait-for-peer pattern (TLS
//     handshake waiting for ServerHello, KeyUpdate responses, alerts)
//     sends writes through the coalescer and then blocks on a read.
//   - Explicit Flush after each framed write burst covers write-only
//     streams that never read.
//   - Close flushes close_notify before closing.
